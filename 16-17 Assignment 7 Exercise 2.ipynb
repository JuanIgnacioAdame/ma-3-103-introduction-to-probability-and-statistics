    "is a laser “tape measure.” It is battery powered and has digital readout of the length. The length is measured with an error $e$ that has mean zero and small variance $\\sigma^2$. You have two boards, of lengths $A$ and $B$, where $A$ is obviously greater than $B$. You may make two measurements before the battery in your laser tape measure dies. Errors on different measurements are stochastically independent.\n",
    "You could (i) measure each board separately. Or you could (ii) align the boards on one end and measure the difference $A − B$ of their lengths and then put them end-to-end and measure the sum $A + B$ of their lengths."
